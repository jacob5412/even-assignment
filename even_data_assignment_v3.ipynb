    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, the above data suffers from survivorship bias and hence represents the price a customer is willing to pay for a plan instead of predicting the price they should be paying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective of a pricing model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Charge a premium that is proportional to the rate at which an individual or family would claim.\n",
    "* The overall sum of premiums shouldn't be less that the estimated cost of covering all individuals (including existing ones).\n",
    "* A customer's premium shouldn't exceed their coverage. Otherwise, it's pointless for a customer to get insurance. If it does, then they should be ineligible for insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that's mining the underlying pricing might not be bound by the above constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the above aside, the factors that should majorly contribute to determining prices are as follows:\n",
    "* Age\n",
    "* Gender\n",
    "* Plan type and duration\n",
    "* Size of plan (Number of members)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional factors not considered by data include:\n",
    "* Newness to the platform - for new customer offers\n",
    "* Customer reactivation journey \n",
    "    - for those customers who had previous plans\n",
    "    - can we increase their coverage?\n",
    "* Location\n",
    "* Claims history: those with a history of filing claims may be seen as having a higher risk\n",
    "* Credit Score: A lower credit score may indicate a higher risk of filing claims.\n",
    "* Coverage cost: As treatments get more expensive over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the factors currently mentioned in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is simple for individuals, as higher age would lead to higher prices\n",
    "* However, this is a complicated affair for families.\n",
    "    - in a family of four, how would you consider the ages of all family members?\n",
    "    - one such way is to create a vector of ages, and the model can learn the weights\n",
    "    - a vector of ages would also incorporate the size of the family\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Gender\n",
    "\n",
    "* This factor should be coupled with age to determine pricing. As gender alone wouldn't be able to determine coverage.\n",
    "* For example:\n",
    "    - Women around menstrual ages might require additional coverage for pregnancy\n",
    "    - Men around certain ages might experience male-patterned baldness that requires additional coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan and Plan Duration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since both plan and plan months are categorical, we can one-hot encode this variable.\n",
    "* The algorithm should be able to account for volume pricing:\n",
    "    - every additional 3 or 6 months shouldn't necessarily increase the price by 100%, but around 80%.\n",
    "    - a slightly higher price for a better service creates a price anchor - which is why customers tend to chose `PLUS` more often than `LITE`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above features, we require a model that weights factors such as a vector of age while also incorporating non-linearly separable boundaries for gender and age. An ensemble method through boosting might work well. An overfitted model might work well as the possibility of receiving values outside the above three factors is rare. Furthermore, the current objective is to learn how pricing can be mined from pre-existing factors."
